# How Does Unfaithful Reasoning Emerge from Autoregressive Training?  
### Anonymous code release for ICML 2026 submission

This repository contains the implementation of the experiments described in the paper:

> "How Does Unfaithful Reasoning Emerge from Autoregressive Training?  
> A Study of Synthetic Experiments"  
> Anonymous submission to ICML 2026.

This work investigates how unfaithful chain-of-thought behaviors—such as mixed, skip-step reasoning and self-verification—emerge in autoregressively trained Transformers by using a controlled noisy modular-arithmetic task with dedicated faithfulness metrics to reveal phase transitions between reasoning modes.
